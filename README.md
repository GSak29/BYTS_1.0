Deep Learning Projects Presented for Byts India Hackathon 1.0
YOLOv8-Based Real-Time Vision Projects
This repository showcases two deep learning projects built using YOLOv8, optimized for real-time performance on standard devices such as mobile phone cameras and webcams.

1. Indian Currency Denomination Detector
A real-time detection system for Indian currency notes with high accuracy and robustness across lighting conditions.

Selected among the top 25 teams out of 200+ in a national innovation challenge.

Designed for practical deployment in low-resource or assistive applications.

2. Real-Time Indian Hand Sign Translator
Developed during a 24-hour hackathon, this system translates Indian Sign Language gestures into natural language.

Uses YOLOv8 for gesture recognition and a custom NLP module for sentence prediction.

Achieves low-latency performance on consumer-grade devices.

Why YOLOv8?
YOLOv8 was chosen for its:

Real-time inference speed

High detection accuracy

Lightweight architecture suitable for edge devices

Ease of fine-tuning on custom datasets

These projects demonstrate applied expertise in computer vision, deep learning, and real-time AI system design
